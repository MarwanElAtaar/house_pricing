# house_pricing
This repository contains a model for predicting housing prices based on various features such as total rooms, total bedrooms, population, and households. The data is processed using transformations like logarithmic scaling, and additional feature engineering is performed to enhance the model's performance.

## Project Overview

The aim of this project is to build a predictive model for housing prices using a dataset with features like the number of rooms, number of bedrooms, population, and number of households. The model applies logarithmic transformation to normalize the skewed distributions and creates new features for a better understanding of the relationships between variables.
